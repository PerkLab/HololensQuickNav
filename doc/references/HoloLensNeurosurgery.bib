  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is an imaging technology by which virtual objects are overlaid onto images of real objects captured in real time by a tracking camera. This study aimed to introduce a novel AR guidance system called virtual protractor with augmented reality (VIPAR) to visualize a needle trajectory in 3D space during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). The AR system used for this study comprised a head-mount display (HMD) with a tracking camera and a marker sheet. An augmented scene was created by overlaying the preoperatively generated needle trajectory path onto a marker detected on the patient using AR software, thereby providing the surgeon with augmented views in real time through the HMD. The accuracy of the system was evaluated by using a computer-generated simulation model in a spine phantom and also evaluated clinically in 5 patients. In the 40 spine phantom trials, the error of the insertion angle (EIA), defined as the difference between the attempted angle and the insertion angle, was evaluated using 3D CT scanning. Computed tomography analysis of the 40 spine phantom trials showed that the EIA in the axial plane significantly improved when VIPAR was used compared with when it was not used (0.96degree + 0.61degree vs 4.34degree + 2.36degree, respectively). The same held true for EIA in the sagittal plane (0.61degree + 0.70degree vs 2.55degree + 1.93degree, respectively). In the clinical evaluation of the AR system, 5 patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures underwent VIPAR-guided PVP from October 2011 to May 2012. The postoperative EIA was evaluated using CT. The clinical results of the 5 patients showed that the EIA in all 10 needle insertions was 2.09degree + 1.3degree in the axial plane and 1.98degree + 1.8degree in the sagittal plane. There was no pedicle breach or leakage of polymethylmethacrylate. VIPAR was successfully used to assist in needle insertion during PVP by providing the surgeon with an ideal insertion point and needle trajectory through the HMD. The findings indicate that AR guidance technology can become a useful assistive device during spine surgeries requiring percutaneous procedures.},

  abstract = {Planning surgical interventions is a complex task, demanding a high degree of perceptual, cognitive, and sensorimotor skills to reduce intra- and postoperative complications. This process requires spatial reasoning to coordinate between the preoperatively acquired medical images and patient reference frames. In the case of neurosurgical interventions, traditional approaches to planning tend to focus on providing a means for visualizing medical images, but rarely support transformation between different spatial reference frames. Thus, surgeons often rely on their previous experience and intuition as their sole guide to perform mental transformation. In case of junior residents, this may lead to longer operation times or increased chance of error under additional cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a mixed augmented/virtual reality system to facilitate training for planning a common neurosurgical procedure, brain tumour resection. The proposed system is designed and evaluated with human factors explicitly in mind, alleviating the difficulty of mental transformation. Our results indicate that, compared to conventional planning environments, the proposed system greatly improves the non-clinicians' performance independent of the sensorimotor tasks performed (p{\textless}0:01). Furthermore, the use of the proposed system by clinicians resulted in a significant reduction in time to perform clinically relevant tasks (p{\textless}0:05). These results demonstrate the role of mixed-reality systems in assisting residents to develop necessary spatial reasoning skills needed for planning brain tumour resection, improving patient outcomes.},

  abstract  = {Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of multiple treatment modali- ties for the management of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) patients. Background: Current management strategies of CSDHs remain widely con- troversial. Treatment options vary from medical therapy and bedside proce- dures to major operative techniques.Methods: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid), EMBASE, CINAHL, Google scholar, and the Cochrane library from January 1970 through February 2013 for randomized and observational studies reporting one or more outcome following the management of symptomatic patients with CSDH. In- dependent reviewers evaluated the quality of studies and abstracted the data on the safety and efficacy of percutaneous bedside twist-drill drainage, single or multiple operating room burr holes, craniotomy, corticosteroids as a main or adjuvant therapy, use of drains, irrigation of the hematoma cavity, bed rest, and treatment of recurrences following CSDH management. Mortality, morbidity, cure, and recurrence rates were examined for each management option. Ran- domized, prospective, retrospective, and overall observational studies were analyzed separately. Pooled estimates, confidence intervals (CIs), and rel- ative risks (RRs) were calculated for all outcomes using a random-effects model.Results: A total of 34,829 patients from 250 studies met our eligibility criteria. Sixteen trials were randomized, and the remaining 234 were observational. We included our unpublished single center series of 834 patients. When comparing percutaneous bedside drainage to operating room burr hole evacuation, there was no significant difference in mortality (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46–1.05; P = 0.09), morbidity (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.2–1.01; P = 0.05), cure (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98–1.11; P = 0.15), and recurrence rates (RR, 1; 95% CI, 0.66– 1.52; P = 0.99). Higher morbidity was associated with the adjuvant use of corticosteroids (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.54–2.45; P = 0.005), with no significant improvement in recurrence and cure rates. The use of drains following CSDH drainage resulted in a significant decrease in recurrences (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27–0.76; P = 0.002). Craniotomy was associated with higher complication rates if considered initially (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04–1.74; P = 0.01); however, craniotomy was superior to minimally invasive procedures in the management of recurrences (RR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05–0.85; P = 0.003).Conclusions: Percutaneous bedside twist-drill drainage is a relatively safe and effective first-line management option. These findings may result in po- tential health cost savings and eliminate perioperative risks related to general anesthetic.},

  abstract  = {Aim We present a newly designed, localiser-free, head-mounted system featuring augmented reality as an aid to maxillofacial bone surgery, and assess the potential utility of the device by conducting a feasibility study and validation.
Methods Our head-mounted wearable system facilitating augmented surgery was developed as a stand-alone, video-based, see-through device in which the visual features were adapted to facilitate maxillofacial bone surgery. We implement a strategy designed to present augmented reality information to the operating surgeon. LeFort1 osteotomy was chosen as the test procedure. The system is designed to exhibit virtual planning overlaying the details of a real patient. We implemented a method allowing performance of waferless, augmented-reality assisted bone repositioning. In vitro testing was conducted on a physical replica of a human skull, and the augmented reality system was used to perform LeFort1 maxillary repositioning. Surgical accuracy was measured with the aid of an optical navigation system that recorded the coordinates of three reference points (located in anterior, posterior right, and posterior left positions) on the repositioned maxilla. The outcomes were compared with those expected to be achievable in a three-dimensional environment. Data were derived using three levels of surgical planning, of increasing complexity, and for nine different operators with varying levels of surgical skill.
Results The mean error was 1.70 ?? 0.51 mm. The axial errors were 0.89 ?? 0.54 mm on the sagittal axis, 0.60 ?? 0.20 mm on the frontal axis, and 1.06 ?? 0.40 mm on the craniocaudal axis. The simplest plan was associated with a slightly lower mean error (1.58 ?? 0.37 mm) compared with the more complex plans (medium: 1.82 ?? 0.71 mm; difficult: 1.70 ?? 0.45 mm). The mean error for the anterior reference point was lower (1.33 ?? 0.58 mm) than those for both the posterior right (1.72 ?? 0.24 mm) and posterior left points (2.05 ?? 0.47 mm). No significant difference in terms of error was noticed among operators, despite variations in surgical experience. Feedback from surgeons was acceptable; all tests were completed within 15 min and the tool was considered to be both comfortable and usable in practice.
Conclusion We used a new localiser-free, head-mounted, wearable, stereoscopic, video see-through display to develop a useful strategy affording surgeons access to augmented reality information. Our device appears to be accurate when used to assist in waferless maxillary repositioning. Our results suggest that the method can potentially be extended for use with many surgical procedures on the facial skeleton. Further, our positive results suggest that it would be appropriate to proceed to in vivo testing to assess surgical accuracy under real clinical conditions.},

  abstract  = {Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is an increasingly common neurological disease process. Despite the wide prevalence of cSDH, there remains a lack of consensus regarding numerous aspects of its clinical management. We provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of cSDH and discuss several contro- versial management issues, including the timing of post- operative resumption of anticoagulant medications, the effectiveness of anti-epileptic prophylaxis, protocols for mobilization following evacuation of cSDH, as well as the comparative effectiveness of the various techniques of surgical evacuation. A PubMed search was carried out through October 19, 2010 using the following keywords: “subdural hematoma”, “craniotomy”, “burr-hole”, “man- agement”, “anticoagulation”, “seizure prophylaxis”, “anti- platelet”, “mobilization”, and “surgical evacuation”, alone and in combination. Relevant articles were identified and back-referenced to yield additional papers. A meta-analysis was then performed comparing the efficacy and complica- tions associated with the various methods of cSDH evacuation. There is general agreement that significant coagulopathy should be reversed expeditiously in patients presenting with cSDH. Although protocols for gradual resumption of anti-coagulation for prophylaxis of venous thrombosis may be derived from guidelines for other neurosurgical procedures, further prospective study is necessary to determine the optimal time to restart full-dose anti-coagulation in the setting of recently drained cSDH. There is also conflicting evidence to support seizure prophylaxis in patients with cSDH, although the existing literature supports prophylaxis in patients who are at a higher risk for seizures. The published data regarding surgical technique for cSDH supports primary twist drill craniostomy (TDC) drainage at the bedside for patients who are high-risk surgical candidates with non-septated cSDH and craniotomy as a first-line evacuation technique for cSDH with significant membranes. Larger prospective studies addressing these aspects of cSDH management are necessary to establish definitive recommendations.},

  abstract  = {Purpose: Neuronavigation based on preoperative imaging data is a ubiquitous tool for image guidance in
neurosurgery. However, it is rendered unreliable when brain shift invalidates the patient-to-image registration.
Many investigators have tried to explain, quantify, and compensate for this phenomenon to allow
extended use of neuronavigation systems for the duration of surgery. The purpose of this paper is to
present an overview of the work that has been done investigating brain shift.
Methods: A review of the literature dealing with the explanation, quantification and compensation of
brain shift is presented. The review is based on a systematic search using relevant keywords and phrases
in PubMed. The review is organized based on a developed taxonomy that classifies brain shift as occurring
due to physical, surgical or biological factors.
Results: This paper gives an overview of the work investigating, quantifying, and compensating for brain
shift in neuronavigation while describing the successes, setbacks, and additional needs in the field. An
analysis of the literature demonstrates a high variability in the methods used to quantify brain shift as
well as a wide range in the measured magnitude of the brain shift, depending on the specifics of the intervention.
The analysis indicates the need for additional research to be done in quantifying independent
effects of brain shift in order for some of the state of the art compensation methods to become useful.
Conclusion: This review allows for a thorough understanding of the work investigating brain shift and
introduces the needs for future avenues of investigation of the phenomenon.},

Surgical treatment is the treatment of choice and burr hole trephination (BHT) is widely performed. The recurrence rate in the patients with CSDH is 3.7-30%. This study investigated the risk factors associated with the re- currence of patients with CSDH who underwent BHT.Methods: One hundred twenty- ve patients with CSDH underwent BHT. Eight of 125 patients (6.4%) underwent reopera- tion for recurrent CSDH. We retrospectively analyzed demographic, clinical and radiological  ndings, catheter tip location and drainage duration as the risk factors for the recurrence of CSDH.Results: Recurrence of CSDH in the high- or mixed-density groups was signi cantly higher than those in the low- or iso- density groups (p<0.001). Placement of catheter tip at the temporoparietal area was associated with a signi cantly higher recurrence rate of CSDH than placement at the frontal area (p=0.006) and the brain re-expansion rate (BRR) was much low- er than placement at the frontal area (p<0.001).Conclusion: The operation may be delayed in high- and mixed-density groups, unless severe symptoms or signs are pres- ent. In addition, placing the catheter tip at the frontal area helps to reduce the incidence of postoperative recurrence of CSDH and to increase the BRR.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and accuracy of ventriculostomy by neurosurgical trainees.
METHODS: Initial computed tomographic studies of 346 consecutive patients who
underwent bedside ventriculostomy were reviewed retrospectively. Diagnosis, catheter
tip location, midline shift, and procedural complications were tabulated. To analyze
catheter placement, we used a new grading system: Grade 1, optimal placement in the
ipsilateral frontal horn or third ventricle; Grade 2, functional placement in the contralateral
lateral ventricle or noneloquent cortex; and Grade 3, suboptimal placement
in the eloquent cortex or nontarget cerebrospinal fluid space, with or without functional
drainage. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher’s exact test and a weighted
κ coefficient.
RESULTS: Diagnoses included the following: subarachnoid hemorrhage, n  153 (44%);
trauma, n  64 (18%); intracerebral hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage, n  63
(18%); and other, n  66 (20%). There were 266 (77%) Grade 1, 34 (10%) Grade 2,
and 46 (13%) Grade 3 catheter placements. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 17
(5%). Four patients (1.2%) were symptomatic, with two (0.6%) requiring surgery. Interand
intraobserver agreement was almost perfect (κ  0.846 and 0.922, respectively)
as applied to our grading system. Rates of suboptimal placement were highest in patients
with midline shift (P  0.059) and trauma (P  0.0001). Rates of optimal placement
were highest in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (P  0.003) and when the
catheter was placed ipsilateral to the side of midline shift (P  0.063). Neither the resident’s
training experience nor the side of placement seemed to affect accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Bedside ventriculostomy is a safe and accurate procedure for intracranial
pressure monitoring and cerebrospinal fluid drainage.

  abstract  = {Objective: Although twist-drill craniostomy (TDC) has a number of procedural advantages and an equivalent outcome compared to burr hole craniostomy (BHC) for the treatment of chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs), the latter technique remains the preferred method. We analyzed symptomatic CSDHs in whom TDC at the pre-coronal suture entry point (PCSEP) was the primary method for hematoma drainage and BHC on the parietal was the secondary option.Methods: CSDHs in 86 consecutive patients were included. TDC at the PCSEP, which is 1 cm anterior to coronal suture at the level of the superior temporal line, was the primary operational technique when the hematoma thickness was suitable, and BHC was performed via the parietal when TDC was unreasonable or failed. The clinical feasibility and outcomes of these approaches were analyzed.Results: Of the 86 patients, 68 (79.1%) were treated by TDC, and 18 (20.9%) by BHC. All patients showed improvements in their symptoms after hematoma drainage. Neither morbidity nor mortality was associated with either technique, and there were no differences in drainage days between the groups. Ten patients had bilateral hematomas and were treated us- ing TDC. Two patients were not suf ciently treated by TDC and, as a result, BHC was applied. Only six hematomas (7% of 86 hematomas) exhibited insuf cient thickness on the computed tomography to perform TDC.Conclusion: When the hematoma was thick enough, a majority of the CSDHs were drained using TDC at the PCSEP as the  rst procedure, which was especially useful for bilateral hematomas and in elderly patients.},

  abstract  = {Background. Primary brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of benign and malignant tumors arising from the brain parenchyma
and its surrounding structures. The epidemiology of these tumors is poorly understood. The aim of our study is to systematically
review the latest literature on the incidence and prevalence of primary brain tumors.
Methods. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to a predetermined protocol and established
guidelines. Only studies reporting on data from 1985 onward were included. Articles were included if they met the following criteria:
(i) original research, (ii) population based, (iii) reported an incidence or prevalence estimate of primary brain tumors.
Results. From the 53 eligible studies overall, 38 were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects model found the overall
incidence rate of all brain tumors to be 10.82 (95% CI: 8.63–13.56) per 100 000 person-years. The incidence proportion estimates
were heterogeneous, even among the same tumor subtypes, and ranged from 0.051 per 100 000 (germ cell tumors) to 25.48 per
100 000 (all brain tumors). There were insufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis of the prevalence of primary brain tumors.
Conclusions. There is a need for more accurate and comparable incidence and prevalence estimates of primary brain tumors
across the world. A standardized approach to the study of the epidemiology of these tumors is needed to better understand
the burden of brain tumors and the possible geographical variations in their incidence.},

reality based on functional neuronavigation and intraoperative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for glioma
surgery has not been previously investigated.
- METHODS: The study population consisted of 79 glioma
patients and 55 control subjects. Preoperatively, the lesion
and related eloquent structures were visualized by diffusion
tensor tractography and blood oxygen leveledependent
functional MRI. Intraoperatively, microscope-based
functional neuronavigation was used to integrate the
reconstructed eloquent structure and the real head and
brain, which enabled safe resection of the lesion. Intraoperative
MRI was used to verify brain shift during the
surgical process and provided quality control during surgery.
The control group underwent surgery guided by
anatomic neuronavigation.
- RESULTS: Virtual and augmented reality protocols based
on functional neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI
provided useful information for performing tailored and
optimized surgery. Complete resection was achieved in 55
of 79 (69.6%) glioma patients and 20 of 55 (36.4%) control
subjects, with average resection rates of 95.2%  8.5% and
84.9%  15.7%, respectively. Both the complete resection
rate and average extent of resection differed significantly
between the 2 groups (P < 0.01). Postoperatively, the rate of
preservation of neural functions (motor, visual field, and
language) was lower in controls than in glioma patients at
2 weeks and 3 months (P < 0.01).
- CONCLUSION: Combining virtual and augmented reality
based on functional neuronavigation and intraoperative
MRI can facilitate resection of gliomas involving eloquent

  abstract  = {Introduction The neuronavigator has become indispensable for brain surgery and works in the manner of point-to-point navigation. Because the positional information is indicated on a personal computer (PC) monitor, surgeons are required to rotate the dimension of the magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography scans to match the surgical field. In addition, they must frequently alternate their gaze between the surgical field and the PC monitor. Objective To overcome these difficulties, we developed an augmented reality-based navigation system with whole-operation-room tracking. Methods A tablet PC is used for visualization. The patient's head is captured by the back-face camera of the tablet. Three-dimensional images of intracranial structures are extracted from magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography and are superimposed on the video image of the head. When viewed from various directions around the head, intracranial structures are displayed with corresponding angles as viewed from the camera direction, thus giving the surgeon the sensation of seeing through the head. Whole-operation-room tracking is realized using a VICON tracking system with 6 cameras. Results A phantom study showed a spatial resolution of about 1 mm. The present system was evaluated in 6 patients who underwent tumor resection surgery, and we showed that the system is useful for planning skin incisions as well as craniotomy and the localization of superficial tumors. Conclusions The main advantage of the present system is that it achieves volumetric navigation in contrast to conventional point-to-point navigation. It extends augmented reality images directly onto real surgical images, thus helping the surgeon to integrate these 2 dimensions intuitively.},

  abstract  = {Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common neurosurgical conditions. There is lack of uniformity in the treatment of CSDH amongst surgeons in terms of various treatment strategies. Clinical presentation may vary from no symptoms to unconsciousness. CSDH is usually diagnosed by contrast‐enhanced computed tomography scan. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is more sensitive in the diagnosis of bilateral isodense CSDH, multiple loculations, intrahematoma membranes, fresh bleeding, hemolysis, and the size of capsule. Contrast‐enhanced CT or MRI could detect associated primary or metastatic dural diseases. Although definite history of trauma could be obtained in a majority of cases, some cases may be secondary to coagulation defect, intracranial hypotension, use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs, etc., Recurrent bleeding, increased exudates from outer membrane, and cerebrospinal fluid entrapment have been implicated in the enlargement of CSDH. Burr‐hole evacuation is the treatment of choice for an uncomplicated CSDH. Most of the recent trials favor the use of drain to reduce recurrence rate. Craniotomy and twist drill craniostomy also play a role in the management. Dural biopsy should be taken, especially in recurrence and thick outer membrane. Nonsurgical management is reserved for asymptomatic or high operative risk patients. The steroids and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may also play a role in the management. Single management strategy is not appropriate for all the cases of CSDH. Better understanding of the nature of the pathology, rational selection of an ideal treatment strategy for an individual patient, and identification of the merits and limitations of different surgical techniques could help in improving the prognosis.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ventriculostomy is a neurosurgical procedure for providing therapeutic cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Complications may arise during repeated attempts at placing the catheter in the ventricle. We studied the impact of simulation-based practice with a library of virtual brains on neurosurgery residents' performance in simulated and live surgical ventriculostomies. METHODS: Using computed tomographic scans of actual patients, we developed a library of 15 virtual brains for the ImmersiveTouch system, a head- and hand-tracked augmented reality and haptic simulator. The virtual brains represent a range of anatomies including normal, shifted, and compressed ventricles. Neurosurgery residents participated in individual simulator practice on the library of brains including visualizing the 3-dimensional location of the catheter within the brain immediately after each insertion. Performance of participants on novel brains in the simulator and during actual surgery before and after intervention was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: Simulator cannulation success rates increased after intervention, and live procedure outcomes showed improvement in the rate of successful cannulation on the first pass. However, the incidence of deeper, contralateral (simulator) and third-ventricle (live) placements increased after intervention. Residents reported that simulations were realistic and helpful in improving procedural skills such as aiming the probe, sensing the pressure change when entering the ventricle, and estimating how far the catheter should be advanced within the ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: Simulator practice with a library of virtual brains representing a range of anatomies and difficulty levels may improve performance, potentially decreasing complications due to inexpert technique.},
