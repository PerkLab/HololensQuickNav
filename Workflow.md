## Workflow

### Med Student / Resident / Neurosurgeon Training

* Med Students rotate every few weeks - get their numbers and ask for 10 minutes to go through software and get their consent (before any cases with them assisting) (Zac/Sarah)
* Residents rotate every month - same as above (Zac/Sarah)
* Neurosurgeons will all be trained near start of the Summer individually, consent to be obtained at Neuro Division Meeting on May 7th @ 5pm (Zac/Sarah)

### Patient Recruitment & HoloLens Prep

* Day prior to knowing we are available, check KGH OR schedule for patients (Zac/Sarah)
* If there are any scheduled, call them, get verbal consent after talking to them about the study (Zac/Sarah)
* Get images on USB (Still need to talk to Ron about details of this), anonymize, segment (Zac/Sarah)
* Load segmentation and patient head surface into Unity as head and lesion models, build software and deploy to HoloLens (Zac)

### Pre & Intra-Op

* Meet patient before procedure to get written consent (Zac/Sarah)
* Enter OR and follow procedures, get scrubbed in, etc (Nurses, etc will give run through on this first few times through) (Zac/Sarah)
* Create approximate registration with HoloLens to hand off to trainee (Zac/Sarah)
* Have Med Student identify entry point and trajectory conventionally, scan with Camera (Zac/Sarah)
* Have Med Student identify entry point and trajectory with HoloLens, scan with Camera (Zac/Sarah)
* Have Resident identify entry point and trajectory conventionally, scan with Camera (Zac/Sarah)
* Have Resident identify entry point and trajectory with HoloLens, scan with Camera (Zac/Sarah)
* Have Neurosurgeon identify entry point and trajectory conventionally, scan with Camera (Zac/Sarah)
* Have Neurosurgeon identify entry point and trajectory with HoloLens, scan with Camera (Zac/Sarah)
* When neuronav system is setup and registered by the Neurosurgeon, scan entry point and trajectory with Camera (Zac/Sarah)

### Post-Op

* Update new row of patient spreadsheet with P_id, age, date of procedure, procedure type, and all results from 7 scans above (Zac/Sarah)
* Take consent form for the patient with information for Ron and slide under his office door for him to update master study spreadsheet (Zac/Sarah)
